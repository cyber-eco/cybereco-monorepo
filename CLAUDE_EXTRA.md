  üìä Technical Achievements

  Architecture Improvements

  1. Centralized UI Logic: All common UI components now live in libs/ui-components
  2. Consistent Theming: Theme variables defined once, used everywhere
  3. Unified Context: Single GlobalProvider manages theme, language, and toasts
  4. Type Safety: Full TypeScript support with exported interfaces
  5. Mobile-First: All components designed with mobile responsiveness in mind

  Code Quality

  1. DRY Principle: Eliminated duplicate code across applications
  2. Separation of Concerns: Clear boundaries between shared and app-specific code
  3. Testability: High test coverage with isolated unit tests
  4. Accessibility: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, focus management

  Developer Experience

  1. Easy Integration: Simple imports from @cybereco/ui-components
  2. Flexible Configuration: Components accept props for customization
  3. Consistent Patterns: Similar API design across all components
  4. Clear Documentation: Both inline JSDoc and external documentation

  üöß Known Issues & Limitations

  1. JustSplit Test Configuration

  - Issue: Jest cannot resolve @cybereco/ui-components imports
  - Root Cause: Complex module resolution between Next.js, Jest, and NX
  - Current Workaround: Created mock files for testing
  - Impact: Tests run but don't test actual component integration

  2. NX Build Warnings

  - Issue: ESLint warnings about missing node modules
  - Impact: Warnings only, builds complete successfully
  - Solution: May need to clean and reinstall dependencies

  3. Website Static Export

  - Issue: Must use npm run build instead of nx build website
  - Root Cause: NX configuration conflict with Next.js static export
  - Impact: Deployment scripts must use npm directly

  üìã Next Steps & Recommendations

  - Quality: Comprehensive testing ensures reliability

  üöÄ Getting Started with the Components

  For developers wanting to use these components:

  // 1. Import from ui-components
  import {
    Navigation,
    UserMenu,
    Modal,
    toast,
    GlobalProvider
  } from '@cybereco/ui-components';

  // 2. Wrap app with GlobalProvider
  <GlobalProvider>
    <YourApp />
  </GlobalProvider>

  // 3. Use components
  <Navigation 
    links={navLinks}
    actionButton={userButton}
    showConfig={true}
  />

  // 4. Show notifications
  toast.success('Operation completed!');

  This shared component architecture provides a solid foundation for the CyberEco
  ecosystem's continued growth and development.

## Recent Implementation Updates (March 6, 2025)

### 1. Single Sign-On (SSO) System ‚úÖ
- **Implementation**: Hub serves as central authentication provider
- **Key Features**:
  - Cross-origin token-based authentication with SHA-256 signatures
  - 30-second token expiry for security
  - Auth state persistence with 5-minute cache
  - URL-based token passing for cross-port authentication
  - Middleware protection for authenticated routes

### 2. My Data Page ‚úÖ
- **Location**: `/apps/hub/src/app/my-data/`
- **Features**:
  - Three-tab interface (Overview, App Connections, Privacy & Security)
  - Real-time Firebase integration for user data
  - Responsive design with hover effects
  - Full internationalization (English/Spanish)
  - Graceful error handling for missing collections

### 3. Authentication Flow Optimizations ‚úÖ
- **Improvements**:
  - `useHubAuth` hook with caching for instant UI updates
  - Middleware protection for authenticated routes
  - Cookie-based auth state for route protection
  - Navigation tabs hidden for non-authenticated users
  - Immediate sign-in prompts (no loading delays)

## Current Architecture

### Firebase Collections Structure
```
Hub Firebase Project:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ users/          # User profiles with preferences
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ apps/           # Available applications metadata
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ permissions/    # User app permissions and access rights
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ shared/         # Cross-app shared data

JustSplit Firebase Project:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ users/          # JustSplit-specific user data
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ expenses/       # Expense records
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ groups/         # User groups
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ events/         # Events
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ settlements/    # Settlement records
```

### Authentication Flow
1. User signs in at Hub (`localhost:40000`)
2. Hub creates auth token with SHA-256 signature
3. Hub saves auth state to localStorage and sets cookie
4. When launching app, Hub appends auth token to URL
5. App validates token and creates local session
6. Apps check Hub auth state on initial load

### Key Authentication Components
- `AuthContext.tsx` - Central authentication management with Firebase init
- `useHubAuth.ts` - Optimized auth hook with 5-minute caching
- `authTokenService.ts` - Token generation and validation with crypto
- `auth-persistence.ts` - LocalStorage caching utilities
- `middleware.ts` - Next.js middleware for route protection

## Next Steps

## Known Issues & Workarounds

### Firebase Emulator Auth Errors
- **Issue**: "Sending authEvent failed" error in console
- **Cause**: Firebase emulator timing issues
- **Impact**: Cosmetic only, auth still works
- **Workaround**: Error can be ignored

### Cross-Port Authentication
- **Issue**: localStorage not shared between ports (40000, 40002)
- **Solution**: Implemented token-based auth via URL parameters
- **Alternative**: Use Gateway app for unified origin

### Firebase Collections Missing
- **Issue**: Collections might not exist on first run
- **Solution**: Graceful error handling with fallback data
- **Fix**: Create collections in Firebase console

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Sign in at Hub, verify dashboard loads
- [ ] Launch JustSplit, verify SSO works
- [ ] Access My Data page, check all tabs
- [ ] Test logout, verify all apps sign out
- [ ] Access protected route without auth
- [ ] Switch languages, verify translations

### Automated Testing
- Unit tests for auth components ‚úÖ
- Integration tests for SSO flow (pending)
- E2E tests for user journey (pending)

## Environment Variables

### Hub Application
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_HUB_API_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_HUB_AUTH_DOMAIN=
NEXT_PUBLIC_HUB_PROJECT_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_HUB_STORAGE_BUCKET=
NEXT_PUBLIC_HUB_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_HUB_APP_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key
```

## Debugging Tips

1. **Auth Issues**: Check `cybereco-hub-auth` in localStorage
2. **Firebase Errors**: Enable debug mode in console
3. **Translation Missing**: Check LanguageContext.tsx
4. **Route Protection**: Check middleware logs
5. **Token Issues**: Use browser DevTools Network tab
