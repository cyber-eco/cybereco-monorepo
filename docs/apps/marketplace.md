### Data Ownership Model

```typescript
// Product ownership remains with vendor
interface Product {
  type: DataOwnershipTypes.PERSONAL; // Vendor owns product data
  vendorId: string;
  visibility: 'private' | 'public' | 'group';
}

// Orders have shared ownership
interface Order {
  type: DataOwnershipTypes.SHARED; // Both vendor and buyer own
  owners: [vendorId, buyerId];
  consensusRules: {
    modify: 'all',    // Both must agree
    cancel: 'any',    // Either can cancel
    complete: 'all'   // Both confirm completion
  };
}

// Reviews are community data
interface Review {
  type: DataOwnershipTypes.PUBLIC; // Community-owned
  immutable: true; // Cannot be deleted
  verified: boolean; // Proof of purchase
}
```
