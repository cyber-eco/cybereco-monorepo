## 💰 JustSplit Questions

### How does expense splitting work?

**Basic Process**:
1. **Add an expense** with description, amount, and participants
2. **Choose splitting method** (equal, custom, percentage, or shares)
3. **Participants get notified** automatically
4. **Track settlements** as people pay each other back
5. **View balances** to see who owes what

**Example**: $60 dinner split equally among 3 people = $20 each. If you paid the full $60, your friends each owe you $20.

### What splitting methods are available?

**Equal Split**: Divide total equally among all participants
- Best for: Restaurant bills, shared utilities, group purchases

**Custom Amounts**: Manually assign specific amounts to each person
- Best for: Different meal costs, varying consumption levels

**Percentage Split**: Assign percentages that total 100%
- Best for: Income-based splitting, proportional contributions

**Share-Based Split**: Assign shares (1 share, 2 shares, etc.)
- Best for: Different participation levels, time-based costs

### How do I settle up with friends?

**Settlement Options**:
- **Digital payments**: Venmo, PayPal, Zelle, Cash App

**Process**:
